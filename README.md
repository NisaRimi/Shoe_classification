Shoe Classification
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify different types of shoes based on images. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled shoe images, enabling it to recognize and categorize various shoe types such as sneakers, boots, sandals, and more.

Key Features:
Data Preparation: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model training and evaluation.
Model Training: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Performance Evaluation: Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance on unseen data.
Workflow:
Data Loading: Images are loaded and preprocessed using data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
Model Architecture: Implements popular CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to leverage pre-trained weights and fine-tune the model.
Training and Validation: The model is trained on the training set and validated on the validation set to optimize performance.
Testing: The final model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen images.
Technologies Used:
Python
PyTorch/TensorFlow
OpenCV/Pillow for image processing
scikit-learn for performance metrics
This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks and can be extended to various other domains requiring visual recognition.
