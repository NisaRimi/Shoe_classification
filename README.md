Shoe Classification

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify different types of shoes based on images. The model is trained using a dataset of labeled shoe images, enabling it to recognize and categorize various shoe types such as sneakers, boots, sandals, and more.

Key Features:

Data Preparation: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model training and evaluation.
Model Training: Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Performance Evaluation: Includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess model performance on unseen data.

Workflow:

Data Loading: Images are loaded and preprocessed using data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
Model Architecture: Implements popular CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to leverage pre-trained weights and fine-tune the model.
Training and Validation: The model is trained on the training set and validated on the validation set to optimize performance.
Testing: The final model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen images.

Technologies Used:

Python
PyTorch/TensorFlow
OpenCV/Pillow for image processing
scikit-learn for performance metrics
This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning techniques in image classification tasks and can be extended to various other domains requiring visual recognition.

Comparison:

I used two frameworks and two models, ResNet-50 and ResNet-18. Then I ran the models for multiple epochs to compare the outcomes.
